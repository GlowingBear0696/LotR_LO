Lord of the Rims Load Order dividers.

I have created these dividers to aid myself, and now others, in organizing of the load order.

The original information used to create these was from a guide on Discord, and made by Trisscar.

I have since obtained permission to release these to the public.


## Directions

Copy the following folders into your RimWorld Mods directory:

```
01 ====== Core
02 ====== Map Generation
03 ====== Factions
04 ====== Trait Mods
05 ====== Medical Mods
06 ====== Game Behavior
07 ====== Items
08 ====== Races
09 ====== END
```


Afterwards, start up RimWorld as usual and click on the Mod button.

Then find and activate.


Simple, eh?.

Mod Order Guide V4
Credit-'Chevalier XLIV' for readable format, as opposed to previous wall-of-text eye bleeding.

-Core:
Hugslib
Jecstools
Humanoid
!Prepare Carefully! - *Either here, or bottom of the mod list, occasional weird issues.*

Libraries - *Core file packets, if something says it has no content, just code for other mods to build from, that's a library.*
*Terra Core goes here.*

THEN

*immediately after libraries*
Giddy-up Core
Giddy-up Addons
Exp. Doors
Third Age
*If running Combat Extended, it is theorized that it should go right above Third Age, patch to both goes right below both.*
*In theory Rimworld of Magic goes here.*

AFTER ALL OF THAT


-Map Generation:
*Anything that adds biomes, messes with how maps work, or changes how the world map generates. Grand Rivers and Archipelagos go here.*

-Factions:
*Anything that ONLY adds new factions, not new races or types of pawns. Faction Control goes here.*

-Traits:
*Rainbeau's made a few of these. If it just adds traits, or adds slots, it goes here.*

-Medical:
*Yes this includes those that add new bionic parts. No it does not include mods that ONLY add medical tiems. EPOE and Rah's and A Dog Said and Archotech are examples of medical mods.*

-Game Behaviour/Mechanics Mods:
*While You're Up/Hand Me That Brick go here, but ALSO mods like Steel Isn't Flammable, Fewer Inferno Cannons and Greenworld, anything that changes how pawns, items, buildings, or events behave. Emphasis on GAME behaviour.*

-Items:
*Clothing, hair, buildings, items; hats, weapons, Vegetable Garden, nuclear power plants, Rimfactory, Climate Control and Advanced Bridges.*

-Race/Animal Mods:
!!RACES GO AT THE BOTTOM THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!
*Includes Animal Collab, Arachnophobia, Werewolves, Vampires, and other mods that make massive changes to pawns just by being loaded.*



*Sometimes two mods will conflict, and might be fixed by putting one of them above the other when it otherwise wouldn't be. Try this if you have done everything else here and the error still occurs.*
